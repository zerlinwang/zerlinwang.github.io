Hi there! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Oxford. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/) and a member of the [Whiteson Research Lab (WhiRL)](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I previously received a Master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Before that, I did my undergraduate at [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on developing general decision-making agents capable of interacting with complex and dynamic environments. Currently, I am exploring `Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)` as a core solution methodology.

In my sparse time, I enjoy running, hiking, and fitness, as well as anime and video games. Additionally, I am a ploy-glot, fluent in Mandarin, English, and Japanese.
