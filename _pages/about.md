Hi there! I am a Computer Science DPhil student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in the [WhiRL](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and [FLAIR](https://foersterlab.com/) labs. I am fortunated to be co-supervised by Professor [Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/) and Professor [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/). I previously received a Master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Zhiyong Wu](https://thuhcsi.github.io/zywu.html). Before that, I did my undergraduate at [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/). :blush:

My research focuses on developing general decision-making agents capable of interacting with complex and dynamic environments. In particular, I explore `Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)` as a core solution methodology, with a current emphasis on RL methods that leverage offline datasets and pretrained policies. I also care about using RL to tackle real-world challenges like large-scale autonomous driving deployment and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with a particular focus on the role of self-play and reward design. :sparkles:

In my sparse time, I enjoy running, hiking, badminton, and fitness, as well as anime and video games. Additionally, I am a ploy-glot, fluent in Mandarin, English, and Japanese.
I love learning new languages because I believe a new language means a fresh perspective on this wonderful world! :dizzy:
