Hi there! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I am fortunated to be supervised by [Prof. Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/) and a member of the [Whiteson Research Lab (WhiRL)](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I previously received a Master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Zhiyong Wu](https://thuhcsi.github.io/zywu.html). Before that, I did my undergraduate at [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/). :blush:

My research focuses on developing general decision-making agents capable of interacting with complex and dynamic environments. Currently, I am exploring `Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)` as a core solution methodology. :sparkles:

In my sparse time, I enjoy running, hiking, badminton, and fitness, as well as anime and video games. Additionally, I am a ploy-glot, fluent in Mandarin, English, and Japanese.
I love learning new languages because I believe a new language means a fresh perspective on this wonderful world! :dizzy:

I am open to coolaborations. Please feel free to drop me an email if you find my work interesting! :smiley:
